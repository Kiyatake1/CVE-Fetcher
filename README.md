# CVE-Fetcher

CVE-Fetcher is a Python script and application designed to fetch and analyze Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and create an Excel report summarizing the vulnerabilities from a .txt file based on debsecan. If you are on Linux, it runs debsecan and automatically gets info from NVD API.

## Features

- Fetch CVE information from NVD.
- Analyze and summarize vulnerabilities from a .txt file.
- Generate an Excel report with detailed vulnerability information.
- Automatic analysis on Linux using debsecan and NVD API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started with setting up and using CVE-Fetcher.

### Prerequisites for

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using `pip3 install <package-name>`):
  - tkinter
  - requests
  - pandas
  - openpyxl

### Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the CVE-Fetcher with: ./cve-fetcher on CVE-Fetcher-Linux folder on Linux, or use the CVE-Fetcher.exe if you are on Windows.

### Note

- The Linux version of the script runs `debsecan` and fetches information from the NVD API automatically to build the .xlsx.
- On Windows, simply run the provided executable with txt file from a debsecan output.
