# CVE-Fetcher

CVE-Fetcher is a Python script and application designed to fetch and analyze Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and create an Excel report summarizing the vulnerabilities from a .txt file based on debsecan. If you are on Linux, it runs debsecan and automatically gets info from NVD API.

**Requires debsecan in Linux version**

## Features

- Fetch CVE information from NVD.
- Analyze and summarize vulnerabilities from a .txt file.
- Generate an Excel report with detailed vulnerability information.
- Automatic analysis on Linux using debsecan and NVD API.

## Getting Started

To get started with CVE-Fetcher, follow these steps:

Clone this repository.

#### Linux:

- Navigate to the `CVE-Fetcher-Linux` folder.

- Run the CVE-Fetcher with: `./cve-fetcher`.

#### Windows:

- Run the CVE-Fetcher.exe executable in dist folder.

#### Working with Source Code:

- Ensure you have the following prerequisites:
  - Python 3.x
  - Required Python packages (install using `pip3 install <package-name>`):
    - tkinter
    - requests

    - openpyxl

### Note

- The Linux version of the script runs `debsecan` and fetches information from the NVD API automatically to build the .xlsx.
- On Windows, simply run the provided executable with txt file from a debsecan output.
